Q. Find All the first Character/characters in line of the text

Sample Output:-
['Name:',
'Description:',
'Documentation:',
'Contact:',
'UpdateFrequency:',
'Tags:',
' ',
' ',
' ',
' ', ..............]

Q. Find all the domain names where the domain name starts with https

Sample Output: 
opendata
internationalgenome
amazonaws and so oon.....

Q. Write a regular expression to find all the values after the tags.

Sample Output:
[1000 Genomes,
The 1000 Genomes Project is an international collaboration which has established the most detailed catalogue of human genetic variation, including SNPs, structural variants, and their haplotype context. The final phase of the project sequenced more than 2500 individuals from 26 different populations around the world and produced an integrated set of phased haplotypes with more than 80 million variants for these individuals.

Name: Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) Soil Chemistry
Description: |
    This dataset contains field and laboratory data collected through the Africa 
    Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project, which lasted from 2009 through 2018. 
    In this initial release, we are including data collected during Phase I, which 
    spanned from 2009 through 2013. Georeferenced soil samples were collected from 
    many countries throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, and their nutrient content was 
    analyzed using *both* wet chemistry and dry chemistry. The two types of data 
    can be paired to form a training dataset for machine learning, such that the 
    chemical concentrations of certain nutrients can be well-predicted using less 
    expensive dry chemistry techniques.

Name: UK Met Office Atmospheric Deterministic and Probabilistic Forecasts
Description: |
  Meteorological data reusers now have an exciting opportunity to sample, experiment and evaluate
  Met Office atmospheric model data, whilst also experiencing a transformative method of requesting
  data via Restful APIs on AWS. All ahead of Met Office’s own operationally supported API platform
  that will be launched in late 2019.
  
  For information about the data see the [Met Office website](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/data-provision/big-data-drive/wholesale/categories/planetary-scale-applications).
  For examples of using the data check out the [examples repository](https://github.com/MetOffice/aws-earth-examples). 
  If you need help and support using the data please raise an issue on the examples repository.
